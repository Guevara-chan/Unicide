# ⋮Sum⋮
__Unicide__ is an avant-garde HTML5 text formatter, developed to assist pluricellular entites with understanding of speech patterns from [Tinder](https://tinder.com/), [Badoo](https://badoo.com), [Lenorado Dai Winchic](https://vk.com/dayvinchik) and other places, where different animal kingdoms collide.  
Made with [CoffeeScript 2](http://coffeescript.com/v2/), frustration and love (for basic grammar).

# ⋮Featuræ⋮
* Every sentence ends with dot or _one_ other corresponding termination symbol.
* Every closing bracket should be precended with opening one.
* There are single space before comma, not after.
* First letter of every sentence is capitalized.
* Mostly [Codepen](http://codepen.io)-ready.

# ⋮Compatibility⋮
__Unicide__ was best tested with _Chrome 70_ and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which is used to develop it.  
Support for _Mozilla Firefox_, _Edge_ and mobile browsers is mostly established, except for minor ui disambiguation.
